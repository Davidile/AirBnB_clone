# The AirBnB Clone Project

# Description of the Project

This is the Airbnb clone project, which is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface in a clone of AirBnB.

This team project is part of the ALX Software Engineering program, which represents the first step towards building a full web application.

This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

# Installation 
Clone the repository and run the console.py

`git clone https://github.com/**********/AirBnB_clone.git                                                             `

# General Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
============================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
============================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
=============================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: `$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`
